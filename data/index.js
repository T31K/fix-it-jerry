      "Having any problem with Apple product is a nightmare because of its  ecosystem and then the cost associsted with repair. It does comes with a price. So, my daughter‚Äôs Ipad went dead, unexpectedly, fully charged, turned off in morning and daughter came back from school, it wont turn on. And so showed it to Dr i device and as expected it was diagnosed with a motherboard issue and almost 40% the price of new one. So , i was thinking to get my daughter a new one, I remembered an i device repair expert in DPC. So i reached out to him, I thot he left dpc since I couldnt get reply on his Fb messenger. I checked again on dpc group, only to find its now a FB page Fix it jerry. and his clients have grown. So o messeged the business page , handed over ipad, in 1 day told me wat the actual issue was. Veryyyyy competitve price. And much better timeline. Got it yesterday evening. And it works fine , daughter is happy, we are happy. Thanks Jerry for your help. Will always recommend your services.",
