    review: "The guys here really know how to fix. Brought it to my regular shop when my laptop completely died (no power light, charge, screen) and it was left for more than a month attempting to troubleshoot and finally informed that it's not worth fixing because the motherboard is unstable. Fix-it-Jerry took it in and within a day found that it was the CPU was faulty and fixed it they did. Refer picture alive!! They are clear on timelines and very reasonable with charges. Highly recommend!",

He provided honest advice and was very transparent with the price options (cheaper than other options in the area too!) I gave him my phone at 9pm and it was ready to collect at 8am the next morning. I will definitely use his services in the future!',
